# Backend Developer Challenge
This is a simple challenge to test your skills on building APIs.
The ClickBus services use mainly Java and Springboot technologies. However, you can use any language and framework that you feel more confortable.

# What to do
Create a simple API to manage places (CRUD). This API should allow to:
- Create a place
- Edit a place
- Get a specific place
- List places and filter them by name

A place must have the following fields:
- name
- slug
- city
- state
- created at
- updated at

# Requirements
- All API responses must be JSON
- Provide a README.md file with usage instructions (how to run, endpoints etc)
- Provide a testing environment (heroku, docker, etc)

# Recommendations
- Tests, tests and tests
- SOLID
- Code and commits in english (methods, classes, variables, etc)

# Evaluation
- Project structure, architecturing and organization
- Programming good practices
- VCS practices

# Delivery
You must **fork** this repository and commit the solution in the **solution** folder. Your repository must be public. After that, send the repository link on the **kenoby platform**.
